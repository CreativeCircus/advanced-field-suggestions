# Advanced Programming - Field Suggestions

## 1. Assignment
Make it so that when the user starts typing into the field `<input type="text" id="state" name="state">`, the site should
"suggest" what state they might have started typing. Suggested state names should be shown in the div `<div class="suggestions">`, and
when the user clicks one, the suggestions should dissappear and the field should be filled with the state name that was clicked.
